### Bioinfromatics

In this internship, I focused on learning the general workflow of bioinformatics research in relation to microarray data. This included learning about quality control, normalization methods, batch correction, DGE analysis using limma, and functional analysis. I ustilized various Bioconductor R packages and external tools such as Metascape, DAVID, EnrichR, and STRING.
